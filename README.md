# Sign-up-form
This is an example of a sing-up form. It's inspired by the odin project sign-up form example.

It's made with plain html and css, there is no javascript in it(for now), therefore there no interactive elements on this website and it is purely for aesthetic purposes.

The two icons are svg files generated by claude.ai, while the landscape image is a creative commons image from pixelstalk.net and can be accessed at : https://www.pixelstalk.net/wp-content/uploads/images6/Nature-Aesthetic-Backgrounds-for-iPhone.jpg
